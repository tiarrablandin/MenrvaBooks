He failed the entrance exam for West Point, and so became an enlisted soldier with the 7th U.S. Cavalry in Fort Grant, Arizona Territory.  He was discharged in 1897, having been found ineligible for service due to a heart problem.\r\n\r\nHe drifted, working odd jobs at ranches across Idaho, then came to work at his father\'s firm in 1899.  He married Emma Centennia Hulbert in 1900.  In 1904 he left his job and found less regular work, ending up back in Chicago.  He held several low-wage jobs for the next seven years, then, while working as a pencil sharpener wholesaler, he began to write fiction in 1911.  He began reading pulp fiction magazines and decided to aim his fiction toward getting published in these magazines.  His first published story, \"Under the Moons of Mars,\" was serialized in The All-Story magazine in 1912.  He began writing full-time and his first published novel, Tarzan of the Apes, was published in October of 1912.\r\n\r\nIn 1919 he purchased a ranch north of Los Angeles, California which he named \"Tarzana,\" a name which was later adopted by the citizens of the community that sprang up around the ranch.

His career ended when his voice changed, and he decided to become a writer. He published his first story, The Ghost at Palnatoke\'s Grave, in 1822. An acquaintance paid all expenses to send him to grammar school in Slagelse. He also attended school at Elsinore until 1827. He later admitted that his school years were the darkest and bitterest of his life.\r\n\r\nAfter school, Andersen resumed writing. In 1829, he started to see his first successes, publishing a short story, \"A Journey on Foot from Holmen\'s Canal to the East Point of Amager\", and a collection of poems. In 1833 he received a traveling grant from the King and set out to travel through Europe. He published his first novel, The Improvisatore, in 1835. He also published the first set of Fairy Tales, following up with more stories in 1836 and 1837. Although they were not initially successful, they have become his best-known works. He wrote a well-received poem, Jeg er en Skandinav, which celebrated Scandinavism, in 1839.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, following a visit to Charles Dickens in England, Andersen met Danish actor Lauritz Eckardt and Danish ballet dancer Harald Scharff in Paris. In 1860, he met them again in Bavaria, and the three of them spent a week in Munich together. Anderson fell in love with Scharff, and started corresponding with him when Scharff and Eckardt left Munich. They were united when Andersen returned to Copenhagen in 1862.

He began work as a clerk for a tea merchant. After his first novel, Antonina, appeared in 1850, he met Charles Dickens, who became a close friend and mentor. Some of Collins\'s works appeared first in Dickens\'s journals *All the Year Round* and *Household Words* and they collaborated on drama and fiction. Collins achieved financial stability and an international following with his best known works in the 1860s, but began suffering from gout. Taking opium for the pain grew into an addiction. In the 1870s and 1880s his writing quality declined with his health. Collins was critical of the institution of marriage: he split his time between Caroline Graves and his common-law wife Martha Rudd, with whom he had three children.\r\n\r\n**Source**: [Wilkie Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkie_Collins) on Wikipedia.',NULL,'2024-06-02',0,NULL,NULL),(48,'https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7879536-L.jpg','Ray Bradbury','Ray Bradbury is one of those rare individuals whose writing has changed the way people think.

Lié à Gustave Flaubert et à Émile Zola, Maupassant a marqué la littérature française par ses six romans, dont *Une vie* en 1883, *Bel-Ami* en 1885, *Pierre et Jean* en 1887-1888, et surtout par ses nouvelles (parfois intitulées contes) comme *Boule de Suif* en 1880, les *Contes de la bécasse* (1883) ou Le Horla (1887). Ces œuvres retiennent l’attention par leur force réaliste, la présence importante du fantastique et par le pessimisme qui s’en dégage le plus souvent, mais aussi par la maîtrise stylistique. La carrière littéraire de Maupassant se limite à une décennie — de 1880 à 1890 — avant qu’il ne sombre peu à peu dans la folie et ne meure peu avant l\'âge de 43 ans. Reconnu de son vivant, il conserve un renom de premier plan, renouvelé encore par les nombreuses adaptations cinématographiques de ses œuvres.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n(Henry René Albert) Guy De Maupassant is generally considered to be the greatest French writer of short stories. One account says the location of his birth was the Château de Miromesnil, in Dieppe, though this is not certain. His paternal ancestors were of the minor aristocracy, and his maternal grandfather, Paul Le Poittevin, was Gustave Flaubert\'s godfather. His parents separated when he was 11 years old. \r\n\r\nMaupassant was gifted with a photographic memory, which aided him in recollecting events and characters for his stories. As a teenager, Maupassant was shown, by the poet Algernon Swinburne (1837-1909), a mummified hand. He used this haunting image in his early short story La Main Ecorchée (1875). In 1869 Maupassant started to study law in Paris, but soon, at age 20, he volunteered to serve in the army during Franco-Prussian War. After his return to Paris, Maupassant joined the literary circle of Gustave Flaubert, who introduced him to some of the leading writers of his day, including Emile Zola, Ivan Turgenev, and Henry James. Flaubert saw Maupassant regularly and schooled him in the craft of being a writer. \r\n\r\nFrom 1872 to 1880, Maupassant worked as a civil servant, first at the ministry of maritime affairs, then at the ministry of education. Toward the end of this time, Maupassant published his first poetry, Des Vers (1880). Later the same year he published his short story masterpiece, \"Boule de Suif\" (Ball of Fat) in the anthology Soirées de Medan (1880), edited by Emile Zola. The story, set during the Franco-Prussian War, is about passengers on a coach, one of whom is a well-known prostitute, nicknamed \'Boule de Suif.\' The story later inspired director John Ford\'s Western film Stagecoach (1945). \r\n\r\nDuring the 1880s Maupassant created some 300 short stories, six novels, three travel books, and one volume of verse. In tone, his tales were marked by precision of style and a range of expression. Although his stories range from moving drama to sometimes bizarre comedy, it is his macabre horror stories that have received much attention. \r\n\r\nAmong Maupassant\'s best known books is Une Vie (A Woman\'s Life, 1883), about the frustrating existence of a Norman wife, Bel-Ami (1885), which depicts an unscrupulous journalist. Pierre et Jean (1888) was a psychological study of two brothers. The novel was thought to be immoral, according to the classic definition, because the hero succeeds by doing wrong. Maupassant\'s most upsetting horror story, \"Le Horla\" (1887) (not to be confused with another of Maupassant\'s stories called \"The Trip of Le Horla\", which is about a hot air balloon), was about vampire-like ghouls, madness and suicide. \r\n\r\nMaupassant had suffered from syphilis since his 20\'s, which caused him neurological and mental problem in his later years, and which undoubtedly accounts for his shortened lifespan. Some critics have alleged that Maupassant\'s developing illness can be seen through a growing preocuppation with mental illness in his stories. However, the theme of mental illness is present even in his first collection, La Maison Tellier (1881), published at the height of his health. Maupassant\'s horror fiction consists of some 39 stories, only a tenth of his total work. A recurring theme in these is madness: \"A Queer Night in Paris\" is a paranoid nightmare: its narrator feels compelled to walk the streets. In \"Who Knows?\" the subject suffers from delusions about the furniture in his house. \"Diary of a Madman\" is a story about a judge, who commits murder, just for the experience, and condemns an innocent man to death for the crime. \"The Inn\" has many similarities with Stephen King\'s novel The Shining. His story, \"The Hand,\" based on his teenage recollection, has inspired later authors and movie directors. Maupassant\'s writing is sometimes compared with that of Edgar Allen Poe. \r\n\r\nOn January 2, 1892, Maupassant tried to commit suicide by cutting his throat and was committed to the celebrated private asylum of Dr. Esprit Blanche at Passy, in Paris, where he died next year. Maupassant\'s style has been imitated by countless writers, and his influence can be seen on such masters of the short story as W. Somerset Maugham and O. Henry.\r\n\r\n[Source][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.classicallibrary.org/maupassant/index.htm',NULL,'2024-06-02',0,NULL,NULL),(151,'https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7252083-L.jpg','Robin McKinley',NULL,NULL,'2024-06-02',0,NULL,NULL),(153,'https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/13441391-L.jpg','Terry Pratchett','Sir Terence David John Pratchett, OBE more commonly known as Terry Pratchett, was an English novelist, known for his frequently comical work in the fantasy genre.

His first novel, Dying of the Light, set the tone for most of his future work; it is set on a mostly abandoned planet that is slowly becoming uninhabitable as it moves away from its sun. This story, and many of Martin\'s others, have a strong sense of melancholy. His characters are often unhappy, or at least unsatisfied - trying to stay idealistic in a ruthless world. Many have elements of tragic heroes in them. Reviewer T. M. Wagner writes, \"Let it never be said Martin doesn\'t share Shakespeare\'s fondness for the senselessly tragic.\" This gloominess can be an obstacle for some readers.

Butler','An American science fiction writer, one of the best-known among the few African-American women in the field.\r\n\r\n[Comment by Tricia Sullivan, on The Guardian][1]:\r\nOctavia E Butler (1947–2006)\r\n\r\n> I was teaching in New York when I came across Octavia E Butler\'s Kindred in a secondary-school catalogue of novels recommended to support diversity. It caught my attention because Butler was described as a science-fiction writer. I thought I was familiar with science fiction, but I\'d never heard of her – nor have a great many other readers, I suspect. For many years, Butler was the sole African-American woman novelist in science fiction. Kindred tells the wrenching and unforgettable story of a young black woman who time-travels and saves the life of her slaveholder ancestor, but it is, in Butler\'s words, \"a grim fantasy\", not science fiction.\r\n\r\n> Beginning in the 1970s, Butler wrote three sequences of novels: the Patternist books, the Lilith\'s Brood series and the Parable novels (incomplete at her tragic death in 2006). Critically respected, she won the Hugo and Nebula awards, received a Clarke nomination, the PEN lifetime achievement award and a MacArthur Foundation \"genius\" grant. A serious writer working in a field that is seldom taken seriously, Butler addressed biological control, gender, humanity\'s relationship with aliens, genetics and even the development of a fictional religion. Her narratives leave space for the reader\'s involvement while exploring the nature of change. They gaze unflinchingly on power dynamics. \"Who will rule? Who will lead? Who will define, refine, confine, design? Who will dominate? All struggles are essentially power struggles,\" Butler stated, \"and most are no more intellectual than two rams knocking their heads together.\" Butler\'s writing is courageous, stimulating and infused with a rare purity of intention. Crushingly, she died at the height of her powers.

It is the fairy tale of deep spiritual insight as Anotos makes his way through moments of uncertainty and peril and mistakes that can have irreversible consequences. This is also his spiritual quest that is destined to end with the supreme surrender of the self. When he finally experiences the hard-won surrender, a wave of joy overwhelms him. His intense personal introspection is honest as he is offered the full range of symbolic choices--great beauty, horrifying ugliness, irritating goblins, nurturing spirits. Each confrontation in Fairy Land allows Anotos to learn many necessary lessons. As he continues on the journey, many shadowy beings threaten his spiritual well-being and compel him to sing. The songs are irresistible to a beautiful White Lady who is freed from inside a statue by the music, and Anotos remains captivated by her for a long time. He sees the world more objectively; his trek invites a natural descent into feelings of pride and egotism. But his losses and sorrows coalesce themselves into things of grace, and these experiences help his spiritual growth.

S. Lewis\'s Space Trilogy, of whichThat Hideous Strengthis the third volume, stands alongside such works as Albert Camus\'sThe Plagueand George Orwell\'s1984as a timely parable that has become timeless, beloved by succeeding generations as much for the sheer wonder of its storytelling as for the significance of its moral concerns. For the trilogy\'s central figure, C. S. Lewis created perhaps the most memorable character of his career, the brilliant, clear-eyed, and fiercely brave philologist Dr. Elwin Ransom. Appropriately, Lewis modeled Dr. Ransom on his dear friend J. R. R. Tolkien, for in the scope of its imaginative achievement and the totality of its vision of not one but two imaginary worlds, the Space Trilogy is rivaled in this century only by Tolkien\'s trilogy The Lord of the Rings. Readers who fall in love with Lewis\'s fantasy series The Chronicles of Narnia as children unfailingly cherish his Space Trilogy as adults; it, too, brings to life strange and magical realms in which epic battles are fought between the forces of light and those of darkness. But in the many layers of its allegory, and the sophistication and piercing brilliance of its insights into the human condition, it occupies a place among the English language\'s most extraordinary works for any age, and for all time.InThat Hideous Strength,the final installment of the Space Trilogy, the dark forces that have been repulsed inOut of the Silent PlanetandPerelandraare massed for an assault on the planet Earth itself. Word is on the wind that the mighty wizard Merlin has come back to the land of the living after many centuries, holding the key to ultimate power for the force that can find him and bend him to its will. A sinister technocratic organization that is gaining force throughout England, N.I.C.E. (the National Institute of Coordinated Experiments), secretly controlled by humanity\'s mortal enemies, plans to use Merlin in their plot to \"recondition\" society. Dr. Ransom forms a countervailing group, Logres, in opposition, and the two groups struggle to a climactic resolution that brings the Space Trilogy to a magnificent, crashing close.',0,'1945-01-01',NULL,'2024-06-02',0,0,'2024-06-02',NULL,0),(54,'https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/280246-L.jpg','Player Piano','Vonnegut\'s first novel spins the chilling tale of engineer Paul Proteus, who must find a way to live in a world dominated by a super computer and run completely by machines.

More compact than some previous volumes in the saga, this one has the virtues readers have come to expect from the author: meticulous world-building; deft use of multiple viewpoints; highly original and intelligent systems of magic; an admirable wit; and a continuous awareness of the fate of the turnip farmer or peddler caught in the path of the heroes\' armies.

The story is a fabulous trip, spinning madly through space and time in pursuit of nothing less than a fundamental understanding of the meaning of life. It takes place at a time in the future, when \"only the human soul remained terra incognita ... the Nightmare Ages, falling roughly, give or take a few years, between the Second World War and the Third Great Depression.\"\r\n\r\nThe villainous and super rich Malachi Constant is offered a chance to journey into the far reaches of outer space, to eventually live on the planet Titan surrounded by three beautiful sirens. There is the proverbial \"small print\" with this incredible offer, which Constant turns down, setting in motion a fantastic chain of events that only Vonnegut could imagine. The result is an uproarious, freewheeling inquiry into the very reason we exist and about how we participate and matter in the scheme of the universe.\r\n\r\nThe Sirens of Titan is essential, fundamental Vonnegut, as entertaining as it is questing in search of answers to the mysteries of life.  As a work of fiction, it is a sure leap, in terms of craft, over his first novel, Player Piano. His writing here is pared down, more concentrated and graceful, richly in the service of his remarkable ideas.

One founding member, the Rev John Wilkins, really did write science fiction and a book on cryptography--but this isn\'t history as we know it, for here his code book is called not Mercury but Cryptonomicon. And although the key political schemers of Charles II\'s government still have initials spelling the word CABAL, their names are all different...\r\n\r\nWhile towering geniuses like Newton and Leibniz decode nature itself, bizarre adventures (merely beginning with the Great Plague and Great Fire) happen to the fictional Royal Society member Daniel Waterhouse, who knows everyone but isn\'t quite bright enough for cutting-edge science. Two generations of Daniel\'s family appear in Cryptonomicon, as does a descendant of the Shaftoes who here are soldiers and vagabonds. Other links include the island realm of Qwghlm with its impossible language and the mysterious, seemingly ageless alchemist Enoch Root.\r\n\r\nAs the reign of Charles II gives way to that of James II and then William of Orange, Stephenson traces the complex lines of finance and power that form the 17th-century Internet. Gold and silver, lead and (repeatedly) mercury or quicksilver flow in glittering patterns between centres of marketing and intrigue in England, Germany, France and Holland. Paper flows as well: stocks, shares, scams and letters holding layers of concealed code messages. Binary code? Yes, even that had already been invented and described by Francis Bacon.\r\n\r\nQuicksilver is crammed with unexpected incidents, fascinating digressions and deep-laid plots. Who\'d believe that Eliza, a Qwghlmian slave girl liberated from a Turkish harem by mad Jack Shaftoe (King of the Vagabonds) could become a major player in European finance and politics? Still less believable, but all too historically authentic, are the appalling medical procedures of the time--about which we learn a lot. There are frequent passages of high comedy, like the lengthy description of a foppish earl\'s costume which memorably explains that someone seemed to have been painted in glue before \"shaking and rolling him in a bin containing thousands of black silk doilies\".\r\n\r\nThis is a huge, exhausting read, full of rewards and quirky insights that no other author could have created. Fantastic or farcical episodes sometimes clash strangely with the deep cruelty and suffering of 17th-century realism. Recommended, though not to the faint-hearted.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nBook One: [Quicksilver](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL18199543W/Quicksilver)\r\nBook Two: [King of the Vagabonds](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL38479W/King_of_the_Vagabonds)\r\nBook Three: [Odalisque](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL38481W/Odalisque)',0,'2003-01-01',NULL,'2024-06-02',0,0,'2024-06-02',NULL,0),(288,'https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7029509-L.jpg','The Shadow of the Torturer','The Shadow of the Torturer is the first volume in the four-volume series, The Book of the New Sun.
